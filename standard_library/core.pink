# Core structure
# Defines very basic stuff such as parenthesis unwrapping and equality

domain { true, false }
reserve { == } # Commas, curly braces and parenthesis are reserved by the runtime
use { } 

# Parenthesis unwrapping
(x) = x;

# Equality
x == x = true;
x == y = false; # This only works because the case where x == y is checked before!
